# LSUseRs

This repository contains a collection of materials used for series of lecture workshops helping LSU psych department learn R.
Each directory contains both slides as well as some R scripts that were used in the collection.
Notes on each session and its contents can be found below.
Eventually materials will be collated and will be ready for use for any department looking to migrate their department's data cleaning and analysis to R.

## Intro to R  

Session 1 begins with the basics introducing both R and RStudio.
After a brief tour of the environment, the lecture moves step by step from using R as a calculator to basic indexing.
No external datasets are needed as all examples use either manually entered data or the 'iris' dataset.

## Basic Cleaning and Analysis 

Session 2 builds on basic functions and indexing by going through common procedures often used in making a cleaning and analysis scripts in R.
Data used is a subset of real experimental and psychological data from the @mccl. 

Topics covered will include:

* Cleaning up some free text response data (messy gender column), 
* Melting some wide data into long form (making it tidy), 
* Checking the variable classes, 
* Merging on some demographic data to the response data, 
* Looking for outliers and doing preliminary analysis (summary stats and basic plots), and then 
* Running a few of the basic univariate stats (t tests, correlations, regressions, maybe an ANOVA?)

Good data keeping practices are also mentioned here.
